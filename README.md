This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Static HTML Export

To use the template as static html version, run the following command:

1. `npm run export`
2. Then run the inbuilt http server using `npm run serve`.

NOTE: The limitation of static html export is that you can't use dynamic api. To learn more, see: <https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export>

## Building for production

1. Use `npm run build` to build for production. This is different from static html export and can be used with dynamic api.
